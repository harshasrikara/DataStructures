# DataStructures

This project is designed for practice in creating a variety of data structures in various languages. Currently, all the data structures will be coded in JAVA but eventually examples will be created in C++, C# and Python. All data structures for Java use generics and the same node class.

### Linked List

Development complete.
A linked list is a data structure that has a discontinuous set of values stored in it. Each value in the linked list is paired with a reference pointing to the next item on the linked list. This is different from an array where all the values are stored in consecutive memory addresses and therefore there is no need to point to where the next node is. 

##### Singly

Setting singly linked to true when creating the list will create a nextNode oriented list. Added features will eventually make it singly linked in the opposite direction which will give the illusion of insertion in the back of the linked list.

##### Doubly

Setting singly linked to false when creating the list will make the linked list be connected in both directions allowing traversal both forward and backward. Added feature will allow insertion in the back or front of the list.

##### Circular

Both the singly linked and doubly linked list can be made circular. This ensures that the last node connects to the first node and in the case of the doubly linked list that the first node also connects backwards with the first node.

#### Function Documentation

To be added. Will contain an explanation of each function and their role in the linked list as well as future functions that are yet to be incorporated into the design.

### Tree

##### Binary Tree

##### AVL Tree

##### Heaps
