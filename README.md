# DataStructures

This project is designed for practice in creating a variety of data structures in various languages. Currently, all the data structures will be coded in JAVA but eventually examples will be created in C++, C# and Python. All data structures for Java use generics and the same node class.

### Linked List

Currently in development.

##### Singly

Setting singly linked to true when creating the list will create a nextNode oriented list. Added features will eventually to make it singly linked in the opposite direction which will give the illusion of insertion in the back of the linked list.

##### Doubly



##### Circular

### Tree

##### Binary Tree

##### AVL Tree

##### Heaps
